# SOPE_Classes

## Instructions:

If you're using this for the first time, run this command:

`git clone https://github.com/andrebreis/SOPE_Classes.git`

Then, for getting the solution of exercises of a class, run this command:

`git checkout classXX`

*Note: replace XX with the class number. I.E: class01*

This won't work unless the class you're trying to checkout wasn't on the repository when you cloned it. In this case, run:

`git fetch --all`

and then, normally:

`git checkout classXX`

Feel free to switch from class to class, as long as it exists! You can check which classes I have solved, above, in the Branch: dropdown menu
